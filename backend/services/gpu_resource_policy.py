"""GpuResourcePolicy — one front door composing the existing GPU-coordination layers.

Design: docs/local-workspace-only/GPU_RESOURCE_POLICY_DESIGN.md

The repo grew FOUR decoupled GPU-coordination layers — JobOperationGate (exclusivity),
GPUMemoryOrchestrator (VRAM-MB budget), GPUResourceCoordinator (cross-process file lock),
GlobalLoadGate (RAM admission) — plus scattered ad-hoc VRAM-reclaim hacks (ComfyUI /free,
4 copies of Ollama keep_alive=0 eviction). Because the gate does no VRAM math and the
orchestrator isn't called by jobs, a gate holder eats ~14GB the orchestrator never debits
and both can believe they own the 16GB card.

This module does NOT replace those layers — it COMPOSES them so exclusivity and VRAM
reclaim/budget become ONE operation. It is strictly ADDITIVE: existing
``gate.gpu_exclusive`` callers keep working untouched; new/critical paths opt into
``gpu_session(...)``. The VRAM-budget debit is an OPT-IN param (off by default) so adopting
this in one caller never changes another's behavior.

Invariants preserved (see design doc): the gate's 8s release cooldown + fail-fast
``GpuBusyError`` (we delegate straight to ``gpu_exclusive``), the lock-ordering rule, and
the ``plugin_runner`` CUDA-fork sidecar (this module spawns no processes). Reclaim runs
only AFTER the slot is claimed — we never evict on behalf of a job that lost the slot.
